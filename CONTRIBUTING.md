## Development Setup

See [QUICKSTART.md](QUICKSTART.md) for detailed setup instructions.

Quick setup:
```bash
# Backend
cd backend && npm install && npm start

# Frontend (new terminal)
cd frontend && npm install && npm start
```

## Code Style

### JavaScript/React

- Use ES6+ features
- Prefer `const` over `let`, avoid `var`
- Use arrow functions for callbacks
- Keep functions small and focused
- Use meaningful variable names

### File Organization

```
backend/
  src/
    routes/      # API endpoints
    services/    # Business logic
    utils/       # Helper functions
  __tests__/     # Test files

frontend/
  src/
    components/  # React components
    services/    # API clients
```

### Testing

- Write tests for new features
- Maintain or improve coverage
- Test edge cases and error handling
- Use descriptive test names

Example:
```javascript
describe('ReceiptParser', () => {
  it('should parse date in MM/DD/YYYY format', () => {
    // Test implementation
  });
});
```

## API Guidelines

### REST Endpoints

- Use appropriate HTTP methods (GET, POST, DELETE)
- Return proper status codes
- Include error messages in responses
- Follow existing patterns

### Request/Response Format

```javascript
// Success
{
  "success": true,
  "data": { ... }
}

// Error
{
  "error": "Error description",
  "message": "Detailed message"
}
```

- Modifying configuration
- Adding dependencies

Files to update:
- `README.md` - Main documentation
- `DEPLOYMENT.md` - Deployment changes
- `TESTING.md` - New test patterns
